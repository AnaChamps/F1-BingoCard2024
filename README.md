# F1-BingoCard2024
F1 2024 season Bingo card - for fun and practice with front-end programming and design, mostly with HTML. It's my first project after learning basic front end technologies. Was made very quickly since the season was starting.

# How it's made
**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery

Three different folders for CSS, one for font, one for the tiles, and one for the general CSS of the page. JS and JQuery included in the HTML file.

# Known issues and futur improvements
**known issues:** placement of the middle of the page icon when zooming in and out.

**futur improvements:** - responsivness. Didn't practice or implement any responsiveness for this project.
- New file for JS and JQuery
- Sounds?
- More use of JQuery as I know more about it now
